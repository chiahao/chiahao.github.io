> You will not use vi just to create new files. Youâ€™ll spend a lot of your time in vi editing existing files. You rarely want to simply open to the first line in the file and move through it line by line; you want to get to a specific place in a file and start working.

But `vi and Vim Editors Pocket Reference` seems more useful.
