> Starting with ECMAScript 2015, you are able to define own methods in a shorter syntax, similar to the getters and setters. See method definitions for more information.


```javascript
var obj = {
  foo() {},
  bar() {}
};
```

[Method definitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
> Starting with ECMAScript 2015, a shorter syntax for method definitions on objects initializers is introduced. It is a shorthand for a function assigned to the method's name.

[Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Method)
> A method is a function which is a property of an object. There are two kind of methods: Instance Methods which are built-in tasks performed by an object instance, or Static Methods which are tasks that are called directly on an object constructor.

> Note: In JavaScript functions themselves are objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an object reference to a function.
