> In React, it’s conventional to use **onSomething** names for props which represent events and **handleSomething** for the function definitions which handle those events.

> The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file.
 
> Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the API reference. You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.  
> 
> Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.
