Spring Boot Starter Parent POM allows us to manage the following things for multiple child projects and modules:
	Configuration: Java version and other properties
	Dependency management: Version of dependencies
	Default plugin configuration: This includes configurations such as build plugins
It is an easy way to bring in multiple coordinated dependencies ...

	It also provides default configurations for Maven plugins, such as maven-failsafe-plugin, maven-jar-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, and maven-war-plugin.
	所以沒有錯, 的確有 war plugin
