### [SCSS import paths cannot be resolved](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360000048404-SCSS-import-paths-cannot-be-resolved)

Solution: Mark project base folder as `<span style="color:red;">Test</span> Resource Folders` and `Excluded` at the same time!

It is very important to mark as `Excluded`!  
Or IDEA will copy whole project during install!
